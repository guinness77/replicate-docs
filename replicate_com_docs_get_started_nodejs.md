Learn how to run a model on Replicate using Node.js.

This guide includes a quickstart to scaffold a new project with a single command in your terminal, followed by a step-by-step tutorial for setting up a project from scratch. By the end, you'll have a working Node.js project that can run any model on Replicate.

## [Anchor for prerequisites](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/nodejs\#prerequisites) Prerequisites

**Node.js 16 or greater:** The simplest way to install Node.js is using the installer at [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/).

## [Anchor for -quickstart-scaffold-a-project-with-a-one-liner](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/nodejs\#-quickstart-scaffold-a-project-with-a-one-liner) üêá Quickstart: Scaffold a project with a one-liner

To get up and running as quickly as possible, you can use [create-replicate](https://github.com/replicate/create-replicate), an npm package that creates a project directory for you, writes some starter code, installs the dependencies, and runs the code.

Run the following command to scaffold a new project:

Copy

```
npx create-replicate
```

That's it. You should now have a working Node.js project that generates images with the [SDXL](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/sdxl) model using Replicate's API.

If you want to use a different model than SDXL, specify it when creating your project:

Copy

```
npx create-replicate --model black-forest-labs/flux-schnell
```

To learn more about scaffolding new Node.js projects, check out the [create-replicate documentation](https://github.com/replicate/create-replicate).

## [Anchor for -slowstart-set-up-a-project-from-scratch](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/nodejs\#-slowstart-set-up-a-project-from-scratch) üê¢ Slowstart: Set up a project from scratch

If you prefer to manually set up your Node.js project step by step, follow the instructions below.

### [Anchor for step-1-authenticate](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/nodejs\#step-1-authenticate) Step 1: Authenticate

Authenticate by setting your Replicate API token in an environment variable:

Copy

```
export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=r8_******
```

### [Anchor for step-2-create-a-new-nodejs-project](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/nodejs\#step-2-create-a-new-nodejs-project) Step 2: Create a new Node.js project

Copy

```
# create the directory
mkdir my-replicate-app
cd my-replicate-app

# set up package.json
npm init -y
npm pkg set type=module
```

### [Anchor for step-3-install-the-replicate-javascript-client](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/nodejs\#step-3-install-the-replicate-javascript-client) Step 3: Install the Replicate JavaScript client

Use npm to install the [Replicate JavaScript client](https://github.com/replicate/replicate-javascript):

Copy

```
npm install replicate
```

### [Anchor for step-4-write-some-code](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/nodejs\#step-4-write-some-code) Step 4: Write some code

Create a file called `index.js` and add the following code:

Copy

```
import Replicate from "replicate";
const replicate = new Replicate();

console.log("Running the model...");
const [output] = await replicate.run(
  "black-forest-labs/flux-schnell",
  {
    input: {
      prompt: "An astronaut riding a rainbow unicorn, cinematic, dramatic",
    },
  }
);

// Save the generated image
import { writeFile } from "node:fs/promises";

await writeFile("./output.png", output);
console.log("Image saved as output.png");
```

### [Anchor for step-5-run-your-code](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/nodejs\#step-5-run-your-code) Step 5: Run your code

Next, run your code from your terminal:

Copy

```
node index.js
```

You should see output indicating the model is running and the image has been saved:

Copy

```
Running the model...
Image saved as output.png
```

## [Anchor for next-steps](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/nodejs\#next-steps) Next steps

Now you're up and running on Replicate with Node.js. üöÄüê¢

In this guide you used the SDXL image generation model, but you can adapt the code to run any model on Replicate. Try [chatting with images using the LLaVa vision model](https://replicate.com/yorickvp/llava-13b?input=nodejs),
or [writing AI-generated Python code using CodeLlama](https://replicate.com/meta/codellama-70b-instruct?input=nodejs). There are [thousands of public models](https://replicate.com/explore) on Replicate, and you can run any of them using the project you just created.
