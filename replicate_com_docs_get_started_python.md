Reference

[How does Replicate work?](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/how-does-replicate-work) [Client libraries](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/client-libraries) [HTTP API](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http) [OpenAPI schema](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/openapi) [Open source](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/open-source)

Learn how to run a model on Replicate from within your Python code. It could be an app, a notebook, an evaluation script, or anywhere else you want to use machine learning.

Tip

Check out an interactive notebook version of this tutorial on [Google Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1K91q4p-OhL96FHBAVLsv9FlwFdu6Pn3c).

## [Anchor for install-the-python-library](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/python\#install-the-python-library) Install the Python library

We maintain an [open-source Python client](https://github.com/replicate/replicate-python#readme) for the API. Install it with pip:

Copy

```
pip install replicate
```

## [Anchor for authenticate](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/python\#authenticate) Authenticate

Generate an API token at [replicate.com/account/api-tokens](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens), copy the token, then set it as an environment variable in your shell:

Copy

```
export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=r8_....
```

## [Anchor for run-a-model](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/python\#run-a-model) Run a model

You can run [any public model](https://replicate.com/explore) on Replicate from your Python code. Here's an example that runs [black-forest-labs/flux-schnell](https://replicate.com/black-forest-labs/flux-schnell) to generate an image:

Copy

```
import replicate

output = replicate.run(
  "black-forest-labs/flux-schnell",
  input={"prompt": "an iguana on the beach, pointillism"}
)

# Save the generated image
with open('output.png', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(output[0].read())

print(f"Image saved as output.png")
```

## [Anchor for using-local-files-as-inputs](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/python\#using-local-files-as-inputs) Using local files as inputs

Some models take files as inputs. You can use a local file on your machine as input, or you can provide an HTTPS URL to a file on the public internet.

Here's an example that uses a local file as input to the [LLaVA vision model](https://replicate.com/yorickvp/llava-13b), which takes an image and a text prompt as input and responds with text:

Copy

```
import replicate

image = open("my_fridge.jpg", "rb")
output = replicate.run(
    "yorickvp/llava-13b:a0fdc44e4f2e1f20f2bb4e27846899953ac8e66c5886c5878fa1d6b73ce009e5",
    input={
        "image": image,
        "prompt": "Here's what's in my fridge. What can I make for dinner tonight?"
    }
)
print(output)
# You have a well-stocked refrigerator filled with various fruits, vegetables, and ...
```

## [Anchor for using-urls-as-inputs](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/python\#using-urls-as-inputs) Using URLs as inputs

URLs are more efficient if your file is already in the cloud somewhere, or it is a large file.

Here's an example that uses an HTTPS URL of an image on the internet as input to a model:

Copy

```
image = "https://example.com/my_fridge.jpg"
output = replicate.run(
    "yorickvp/llava-13b:a0fdc44e4f2e1f20f2bb4e27846899953ac8e66c5886c5878fa1d6b73ce009e5",
    input={
        "image": image,
        "prompt": "Here's what's in my fridge. What can I make for dinner tonight?"
    }
)
print(output)
# You have a well-stocked refrigerator filled with various fruits, vegetables, and ...
```

## [Anchor for handling-output](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/python\#handling-output) Handling output

Some models stream output as the model is running. They will return an iterator, and you can iterate over that output.

Here's an example that uses the [Claude 3.7 Sonnet model](https://replicate.com/anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet) to generate text:

Copy

```
iterator = replicate.run(
  "anthropic/claude-3.7-sonnet",
  input={"prompt": "Who was Dolly the sheep?"},
)
for text in iterator:
    print(text, end="")

# Dolly the sheep was the first mammal to be successfully cloned from an adult cell...
```

## [Anchor for handling-file-outputs](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/python\#handling-file-outputs) Handling file outputs

Some models generate files as output, such as images or audio. These are returned as `FileOutput` objects, which you can easily save or process:

Copy

```
output = replicate.run(
    "black-forest-labs/flux-schnell",
    input={"prompt": "A majestic lion"}
)

# Save the generated image
with open('lion.png', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(output[0].read())

print("Image saved as lion.png")

# Handle multiple outputs

output = replicate.run(
    "black-forest-labs/flux-schnell",
    input={"prompt": "A majestic lion", "num_outputs": 2}
)

for idx, file_output in enumerate(output):
    with open(f'output_{idx}.png', 'wb') as f:
        f.write(file_output.read())

```

For more details on handling output files, see [Output Files](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/output-files).
