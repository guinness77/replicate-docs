Now you‚Äôre up and running with ComfyUI, you‚Äôll want to start powering-up using some of the best custom nodes that are available.

You should already have the [ComfyUI-manager](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/comfyui/comfyui-manager), which you can use to install these. Alternatively, any custom node can be git cloned into your `ComfyUI/custom_nodes` directory. Make sure you also install any dependencies that are needed.

## [Anchor for upscale-images](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/comfyui/custom-nodes\#upscale-images) Upscale images

[ComfyUI\_UltimateSDUpscale](https://github.com/ssitu/ComfyUI_UltimateSDUpscale) is a wrapper around the A1111 equivalent. It‚Äôs the goto node for upscaling. Use the controlnet tile upscaling options to get detailed outputs at massive resolutions.

Try [running UltimateSDUpscale on Replicate](https://replicate.com/fewjative/ultimate-sd-upscale) to see what‚Äôs possible.

## [Anchor for utilities](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/comfyui/custom-nodes\#utilities) Utilities

### [Anchor for comfyui-custom-scripts-](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/comfyui/custom-nodes\#comfyui-custom-scripts-) ComfyUI Custom Scripts üêç

[ComfyUI Custom Scripts](https://github.com/pythongosssss/ComfyUI-Custom-Scripts) is a set of UI enhancements for ComfyUI, typically enriching the information shown.

You can use it to:

- add autocomplete to your text prompts, very useful for selecting your embeddings from a list
- view extra checkpoint, LoRA and embedding information
- auto arrange your nodes
- snap nodes to a grid
- show an image feed
- lock nodes
- use mathematical expressions (for example when generating latents)
- save your workflows as PNG images

### [Anchor for efficiency-nodes](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/comfyui/custom-nodes\#efficiency-nodes) Efficiency nodes

[comfyui-efficiency-nodes](https://github.com/jags111/efficiency-nodes-comfyui) are a collection of nodes that aim to combine many nodes into one. Use them to streamline workflows and reduce total node count.

## [Anchor for animatediff--and-video-helpers-](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/comfyui/custom-nodes\#animatediff--and-video-helpers-) AnimateDiff üé≠ and video helpers üé•

If you‚Äôre looking to make videos using [AnimateDiff](https://replicate.com/lucataco/animate-diff), then [Kosinkadink‚Äôs ComfyUI-AnimateDiff-Evolved](https://github.com/Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-AnimateDiff-Evolved) is a must.

Use it to:

- create videos from your checkpoints
- use motion loras to control camera direction
- control your outputs using controlnets

It should be used with [ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite](https://github.com/Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite), which can:

- load videos
- combine videos
- preview videos
- make videos from images
