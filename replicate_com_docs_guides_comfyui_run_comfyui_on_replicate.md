Reference

[How does Replicate work?](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/how-does-replicate-work) [Client libraries](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/client-libraries) [HTTP API](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http) [OpenAPI schema](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/openapi) [Open source](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/open-source)

You can run ComfyUI workflows directly on Replicate using the [fofr/any-comfyui-workflow](https://replicate.com/fofr/any-comfyui-workflow) model.

It works by using a ComfyUI JSON blob. You send us your workflow as a JSON blob and we’ll generate your outputs. You can also upload inputs or use URLs in your JSON.

Your browser does not support the video tag.

## [Anchor for how-to-use-the-replicate-model](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/comfyui/run-comfyui-on-replicate\#how-to-use-the-replicate-model) How to use the Replicate model

### [Anchor for get-your-api-json](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/comfyui/run-comfyui-on-replicate\#get-your-api-json) Get your API JSON

You’ll need the API version of your ComfyUI workflow. This is different to the commonly shared JSON version, it does not included visual information about nodes, etc.

To get your API JSON:

1. Turn on the "Enable Dev mode Options" from the ComfyUI settings (via the settings icon)
2. Load your workflow into ComfyUI
3. Export your API JSON using the "Save (API format)" button

Your browser does not support the video tag.

### [Anchor for gather-your-input-files](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/comfyui/run-comfyui-on-replicate\#gather-your-input-files) Gather your input files

If your model takes inputs, like images for img2img or controlnet, you have 3 options:

1. Use a URL
2. Upload a single input
3. Upload a zip file or tar file of your inputs

### [Anchor for using-urls-as-inputs](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/comfyui/run-comfyui-on-replicate\#using-urls-as-inputs) Using URLs as inputs

If you’re using URLs, you should modify your API JSON file to point at a URL:

Copy

```
- "image": "/your-path-to/image.jpg",
+ "image": "https://example.com/image.jpg",
```

#### [Anchor for uploading-a-single-input](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/comfyui/run-comfyui-on-replicate\#uploading-a-single-input) Uploading a single input

You can also give a single input file when running the model. If this is an image or video, we’ll put it directly into the input directory, as `input.[extension]` – for example `input.jpg`.

You can then reference this in your workflow using the filename:

Copy

```
- "image": "/your-path-to/my-picture-001.jpg",
+ "image": "image.jpg",
```

#### [Anchor for uploading-a-zip-file-or-tar-file-of-your-inputs](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/comfyui/run-comfyui-on-replicate\#uploading-a-zip-file-or-tar-file-of-your-inputs) Uploading a zip file or tar file of your inputs

If your model is more complex and requires multiple inputs, you can upload a zip file or tar file of all of them.

These will be downloaded and extracted to the `input` directory. You can then reference them in your workflow based on their relative paths.

So a zip file containing:

Copy

```
- my_img.png
- references/my_reference_01.jpg
- references/my_reference_02.jpg
```

Might be used in the workflow like:

Copy

```
"image": "my_img.png",
...
"directory": "references",
```

We'll always validate that your inputs exist before running your workflow.

### [Anchor for run-your-workflow](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/comfyui/run-comfyui-on-replicate\#run-your-workflow) Run your workflow

With all your inputs ready, you can now run your workflow.

There’s a couple of extra options you can use:

- `return_temp_files` – Some workflows save temporary files, for example pre-processed controlnet images. Use this option to also return these files.
- `randomise_seeds` – Usually you want to randomise your seeds, so we’ve made this easy for you. Set this option to `true` to randomise all your seeds.

## [Anchor for an-example-output](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/comfyui/run-comfyui-on-replicate\#an-example-output) An example output

Input

workflow\_json

{ ... "seed": 156680208700286, "steps": 20, "cfg": 8, "sampler\_name": "euler", "scheduler": "normal", "denoise": 1, "positive": \["beautiful scenery nature glass bottle landscape, purple galaxy bottle", 0\], "negative": \["text, watermark", 0\], "latent\_image": \[512, 512, 1, 0\] ... }

Output

## [Anchor for supported-weights](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/comfyui/run-comfyui-on-replicate\#supported-weights) Supported weights

We support the most popular model weights, including:

- SDXL
- RealVisXL 3.0
- Realistic Vision 5.1 and 6.0
- DreamShaper 6
- TurboVisionXL
- Stable Video Diffusion
- AnimateDiff
- LCM Dreamshaper
- LCM LoRAs

Also included are all the popular controlnets and preprocessors. We recommend using the [`comfyui_controlnet_aux`](https://github.com/Fannovel16/comfyui_controlnet_aux/) custom node for preprocessors. And [`ComfyUI Advanced ControlNet`](https://github.com/Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-Advanced-ControlNet/) is included if you really know what you’re doing.

[View the complete list of supported weights](https://github.com/fofr/cog-comfyui/blob/main/supported_weights.md) or [request a weight by raising an issue](https://github.com/fofr/cog-comfyui/issues).

If your exact model isn’t supported, you can also try switching to the closest match. Just update your JSON to use a different model filename.

## [Anchor for custom-nodes](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/comfyui/run-comfyui-on-replicate\#custom-nodes) Custom nodes

Again, we’ve tried to include the most popular custom nodes.

Some of the custom nodes included are:

- [ComfyUI IPAdapter Plus](https://github.com/cubiq/ComfyUI_IPAdapter_plus/tree/4e898fe)
- [ComfyUI Controlnet Aux](https://github.com/Fannovel16/comfyui_controlnet_aux/tree/6d6f63c)
- [ComfyUI Inspire Pack](https://github.com/ltdrdata/ComfyUI-Inspire-Pack/tree/c8231dd)
- [ComfyUI Logic](https://github.com/theUpsider/ComfyUI-Logic/tree/fb88973)
- [ComfyUI AnimateDiff Evolved](https://github.com/Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-AnimateDiff-Evolved/tree/d2bf367)
- [ComfyUI VideoHelperSuite](https://github.com/Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-VideoHelperSuite/tree/1dbf01b)
- [ComfyUI Advanced ControlNet](https://github.com/Kosinkadink/ComfyUI-Advanced-ControlNet/tree/bd5bcbf)
- [Efficiency Nodes ComfyUI](https://github.com/jags111/efficiency-nodes-comfyui/tree/1ac5f18)
- [Derfuu ComfyUI ModdedNodes](https://github.com/Derfuu/Derfuu_ComfyUI_ModdedNodes/tree/2ace4c4)
- [ComfyUI FizzNodes](https://github.com/FizzleDorf/ComfyUI_FizzNodes/tree/cd6cadd)

[View the complete list of supported custom nodes](https://github.com/fofr/cog-comfyui). You can also [raise an issue](https://github.com/fofr/cog-comfyui/issues) to request more custom nodes, or use the Github repo as a template to roll your own.
