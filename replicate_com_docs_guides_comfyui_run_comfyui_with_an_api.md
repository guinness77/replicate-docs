Reference

[How does Replicate work?](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/how-does-replicate-work) [Client libraries](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/client-libraries) [HTTP API](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http) [OpenAPI schema](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/openapi) [Open source](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/open-source)

You can [run ComfyUI workflows on Replicate](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/comfyui/run-comfyui-on-replicate), which means you can run them with an API too. Take your custom ComfyUI workflow to production.

You can use our official [Python](https://github.com/replicate/replicate-python#readme), [Node.js](https://github.com/replicate/replicate-javascript), [Swift](https://github.com/replicate/replicate-swift), [Elixir](https://github.com/replicate/replicate-elixir) and [Go](https://github.com/replicate/replicate-go) clients.

We recommend you follow these steps:

1. Get your workflow running on Replicate with the [`fofr/any-comfyui-workflow`](https://replicate.com/fofr/any-comfyui-workflow) model ( [read our instructions and see what’s supported](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/comfyui/run-comfyui-on-replicate))
2. Use the Replicate API to run the workflow
3. Write code to customise the JSON you pass to the model (for example, to change prompts)
4. Integrate the API into your app or website

## [Anchor for get-your-api-token](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/comfyui/run-comfyui-with-an-api\#get-your-api-token) Get your API token

You’ll need to [sign up for Replicate](https://replicate.com/signin), then you can find your API token on [your account page](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens).

## [Anchor for run-your-workflow-with-python](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/comfyui/run-comfyui-with-an-api\#run-your-workflow-with-python) Run your workflow with Python

In this example we’ll run the default ComfyUI workflow, a simple text to image flow.

Install Replicate’s Python client library:

Copy

```
pip install replicate
```

Set the REPLICATE\_API\_TOKEN environment variable:

Copy

```
export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=r8-*********************************
```

Import the client and run the workflow:

Copy

```
import json
import replicate

output = replicate.run(
    "fofr/any-comfyui-workflow:latest",
    input={
        "workflow_json": json.dumps({

```

### [Anchor for customise-your-workflow](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/comfyui/run-comfyui-with-an-api\#customise-your-workflow) Customise your workflow

You’ll want to customise your workflow, to send in different prompts and other options. You can do this by changing the JSON you pass to the model.

For example, you could change the checkpoint and prompt like this:

Copy

```
import json
import replicate

def load_workflow_from_file(file_path):
    with open(file_path, 'r') as file:
        return json.load(file)

def update_checkpoint_name(workflow, new_name):
    workflow["4"]["inputs"]["ckpt_name"] = new_name

def update_prompt(workflow, new_prompt):
    workflow["6"]["inputs"]["text"] = new_prompt

workflow = load_workflow_from_file('workflow.json')
update_checkpoint_name(workflow, "sd_xl_base_1.0.safetensors")
update_prompt(workflow, "a photo of a comfy sofa")

output = replicate.run(
    "fofr/any-comfyui-workflow:latest",
    input={
        "workflow_json": json.dumps(workflow),
        "randomise_seeds": True,
        "return_temp_files": False
    }
)
print(output)
```
