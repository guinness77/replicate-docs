Reference

[How does Replicate work?](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/how-does-replicate-work) [Client libraries](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/client-libraries) [HTTP API](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http) [OpenAPI schema](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/openapi) [Open source](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/open-source)

With Replicate, you can run InstantID in the cloud with one line of code.

## [Anchor for usage-tips](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/instant-id/run-instant-id-with-an-api\#usage-tips) Usage Tips

- For higher similarity, increase the weight of controlnet\_conditioning\_scale (IdentityNet) and ip\_adapter\_scale (Adapter).
- For over-saturation, decrease the ip\_adapter\_scale. If not work, decrease controlnet\_conditioning\_scale.
- For higher text control ability, decrease ip\_adapter\_scale.
- For specific styles, choose corresponding base model makes differences.
- We have not supported multi-person yet, will only use the largest face as reference pose.

## [Anchor for run-instantid-with-javascript](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/instant-id/run-instant-id-with-an-api\#run-instantid-with-javascript) Run InstantID with JavaScript

You can run InstantID with our [official JavaScript client](https://github.com/replicate/replicate-javascript):

Copy

```
npm install replicate
```

Set the `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` environment variable:

Copy

```
export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=<your-api-token>
```

Import and set up the client:

Copy

```
import Replicate from "replicate";

const replicate = new Replicate({
  auth: process.env.REPLICATE_API_TOKEN,
});
```

Run zsxkib/instant-id using Replicate’s API:

Copy

```
const output = await replicate.run(
  "zsxkib/instant-id:latest",
  {
    input: {
		"image": "https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/KIIutO7jIleskKaWebhvurgBUlHR6M6KN7KHaMMWSt4OnVrF/musk_resize.jpeg",
		"width": 640,
		"height": 640,
		"prompt": "analog film photo of a man. faded film, desaturated, 35mm photo, grainy, vignette, vintage, Kodachrome, Lomography, stained, highly detailed, found footage, masterpiece, best quality",
		"sdxl_weights": "protovision-xl-high-fidel",
		"guidance_scale": 5,
		"negative_prompt": "(lowres, low quality, worst quality:1.2), (text:1.2), watermark, painting, drawing, illustration, glitch, deformed, mutated, cross-eyed, ugly, disfigured (lowres, low quality, worst quality:1.2), (text:1.2), watermark, painting, drawing, illustration, glitch,deformed, mutated, cross-eyed, ugly, disfigured",
		"ip_adapter_scale": 0.8,
		"num_inference_steps": 30,
		"disable_safety_checker": False,
		"controlnet_conditioning_scale": 0.8
    }
  }
);
console.log(output);
```

Note that InstandID takes an image as input. You can provide URLs or base 64 strings as values for the image.
