### [Anchor for classifier-free-guidance-cfg-scale](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/stable-diffusion/glossary\#classifier-free-guidance-cfg-scale) Classifier-free guidance (CFG) scale

Often used in generative models, it’s used to control the influence of a prompt (or another guiding signal) on a generated output. Higher values will give outputs closer to the prompt, but at the cost of output diversity and creativity.

### [Anchor for controlnet](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/stable-diffusion/glossary\#controlnet) ControlNet

A model that guides the generation of a new image based on aspects or features of an input image. The type of guidance depends on the ControlNet used. A preprocessor is often needed to convert an input image into a format that can guide the generation process. Used alongside Stable Diffusion.

Examples include:

- edge detection (canny)
- depth map
- segmentation
- human pose

[Try out ControlNet with SDXL](https://replicate.com/fofr/sdxl-multi-controlnet-lora)

## [Anchor for d](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/stable-diffusion/glossary\#d) D

### [Anchor for decoder](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/stable-diffusion/glossary\#decoder) Decoder

A neural network component that reconstructs data from encoded
representations.

### [Anchor for denoising](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/stable-diffusion/glossary\#denoising) Denoising

The step-by-step process of gradually transforming noise into a coherent output.

### [Anchor for denoising-strength-or-prompt-strength](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/stable-diffusion/glossary\#denoising-strength-or-prompt-strength) Denoising strength (or prompt strength)

A parameter controlling image alteration in img2img.

Denoising strength controls how much noise is added to the initial image. More noise means more of the original image will change. This gives more opportunity for the diffusion process to match a given prompt (ie prompt strength).

### [Anchor for depth-to-image](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/stable-diffusion/glossary\#depth-to-image) Depth-to-image

A depth map is generated from an input image, usually as a preprocessor for a ControlNet model. This depth map is then used to guide the generation of a new image, leading to a new image with a similar structure.

There are different models for generating depth maps, including:

- Midas
- Leres
- Zoe

[Try out depth maps and other ControlNet preprocessors](https://replicate.com/fofr/controlnet-preprocessors)

### [Anchor for diffusion-model](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/stable-diffusion/glossary\#diffusion-model) Diffusion model

A diffusion model is a type of generative AI model that transforms random noise into structured data, such as images, audio, or text. It gradually shapes this noise through a series of steps to produce coherent and detailed outputs.

### [Anchor for inference](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/stable-diffusion/glossary\#inference) Inference

Running a trained model to get an output. In machine learning, and on Replicate, these outputs are called [predictions](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/stable-diffusion/glossary#prediction).

[Try using negative prompts with Stable Diffusion XL](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/sdxl)

### [Anchor for neural-network-or-neural-net](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/stable-diffusion/glossary\#neural-network-or-neural-net) Neural network (or neural net)

A system designed to mimic the way human brains analyze and process information. It consists of interconnected nodes that work together to recognize patterns and make decisions based on input data.

Nodes are aggregated into layers. Signals travel from the input layer to the output layer via these hidden layers.

[Learn more about neural networks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Artificial_neural_network)

## [Anchor for o](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/stable-diffusion/glossary\#o) O

### [Anchor for overfitting](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/stable-diffusion/glossary\#overfitting) Overfitting

Overtraining. It happens when a model learns its training data too thoroughly. An overfit model will perform poorly on new, unseen data, as it fails to generalize from the specific examples it was trained on.

If you are fine-tuning, try to use a more diverse training dataset or train with fewer steps.

## [Anchor for p](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/stable-diffusion/glossary\#p) P

### [Anchor for prediction](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/stable-diffusion/glossary\#prediction) Prediction

Predictions in machine learning refer to the output generated by a model when it is given new, unseen data. Based on the patterns and relationships it has learned during training, the model estimates or forecasts likely outcomes for this new data.

[View your predictions on Replicate](https://replicate.com/predictions)

### [Anchor for prompt](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/stable-diffusion/glossary\#prompt) Prompt

Text input to a generative AI model describing the desired output.

### [Anchor for prompt-engineering](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/stable-diffusion/glossary\#prompt-engineering) Prompt engineering

### [Anchor for scheduler-or-sampler](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/stable-diffusion/glossary\#scheduler-or-sampler) Scheduler (or sampler)

An algorithm that determines the denoising process for a diffusion model. They play a critical role in determining how the noise is incrementally reduced (denoising) to form the final output.

They are called schedulers because they determine the noise schedule used during the diffusion process. They are sometimes called samplers because the denoising process creates a sample at each step.

Example schedulers include:

- Euler
- DDIM
- DPM++ 2M Karras

[Learn more about schedulers on HuggingFace](https://huggingface.co/docs/diffusers/api/schedulers/overview#schedulers)

### [Anchor for stable-diffusion](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/stable-diffusion/glossary\#stable-diffusion) Stable Diffusion

- [Stable Diffusion 1.5](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/stable-diffusion) (SD1.5, August 2022)

### [Anchor for upscaling](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/stable-diffusion/glossary\#upscaling) Upscaling

Increasing image resolution while enhancing details using an AI model.

## [Anchor for v](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/stable-diffusion/glossary\#v) V

### [Anchor for variational-autoencoder-vae](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/stable-diffusion/glossary\#variational-autoencoder-vae) Variational autoencoder (VAE)

A VAE can:

- encode images into latent space
- decode latents back into an image

Rather than working with pixels, which would be very slow, many diffusion models work in a [latent space](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/stable-diffusion/glossary#latent-space) that is much smaller. This allows them to be more efficient.

During training, training data is encoded into latent space. During inference, the output of the diffusion process is decoded back into an image.
