[How does Replicate work?](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/how-does-replicate-work) [Client libraries](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/client-libraries) [HTTP API](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http) [OpenAPI schema](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/openapi) [Open source](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/open-source)

Ultimate SD Upscale is an [Automatic1111 extension](https://github.com/Coyote-A/ultimate-upscale-for-automatic1111) by Coyote-A. It is a very powerful wrapper around ControlNet tile, giving fine control over all of the parameters, including:

- [denoising strength](https://replicate.com/guides/stable-diffusion/image-to-image#prompt-strength-or-denoising-strength) (ie how much of the original image remains in the final result)
- target image size
- opting into a first-pass upscaler before using ControlNet tile (for example [Real-ESRGAN](https://replicate.com/guides/upscaling-images/real-esrgan))
- the order that tiles are processed in, linear or chessboard. Chessboard can reduce unwanted seams from showing
- the size of the tiles
- the amount of padding around each tile
- the amount of blur applied to the tile masks (to hide seams where tiles are restitched together)
- options for fixing seams after the ControlNet tile upscaling is complete

## [Anchor for using-with-comfyui](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/upscaling-images/sd-ultimate-upscale\#using-with-comfyui) Using with ComfyUI

It has also been [ported to ComfyUI as a custom node](https://github.com/ssitu/ComfyUI_UltimateSDUpscale) by ssitu. We recommend this in [our ComfyUI guide](https://replicate.com/guides/comfyui/custom-nodes#upscale-images) as a must-have custom node in your workflow.

## [Anchor for run-ultimate-sd-upscale-with-an-api](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/upscaling-images/sd-ultimate-upscale\#run-ultimate-sd-upscale-with-an-api) Run Ultimate SD Upscale with an API

User 'fewjative' has wrapped the ComfyUI custom node into a Replicate model that you can run with a production-ready API. [Try out `fewjative/ultimate-sd-upscale`](https://replicate.com/fewjative/ultimate-sd-upscale), or run it with an API using our guide below.

Alternatively, if you want to run your own customised ComfyUI workflow, one that incorporates Ultimate SD Upscale, you can use the `fofr/any-comfyui-workflow` model. [Read our ComfyUI with an API guide](https://replicate.com/guides/comfyui/run-comfyui-with-an-api) to learn how.

### [Anchor for running-ultimate-sd-upscale-with-python](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/upscaling-images/sd-ultimate-upscale\#running-ultimate-sd-upscale-with-python) Running Ultimate SD Upscale with Python

We’ll use `fewjative/ultimate-sd-upscale` for this example.

Start with our [official Python client](https://github.com/replicate/replicate-python) and read our [getting started with Python](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/python) docs.

Copy

```
pip install replicate
export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=<your-api-token>
```

Run [fewjative/ultimate-sd-upscale](https://replicate.com/fewjative/ultimate-sd-upscale):

Copy

```
import replicate

output = replicate.run(
    "fewjative/ultimate-sd-upscale:latest",
    input={
        "image": "https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/KKOaCNy9baG5cUZfK3YvvePBqZeTxyvytifSo7pFOKLySQN2/ComfyUI_00004_.png",
        "steps": 20,
        "denoise": 0.4,
        "scheduler": "karras",
        "upscale_by": 2,
        "negative_prompt": "ugly, broken, weird",
        "positive_prompt": "a portrait photo of a cat in a green hoodie",
    }
)

# Save the output image
with open('output.png', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(output[0].read())
```

A more complete example, that incorporates all of the Ultimate SD Upscale parameters might look like this:

Copy

```
output = replicate.run(
    "fewjative/ultimate-sd-upscale:latest",
    input={
        "cfg": 8,
        "image": "https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/KKOaCNy9baG5cUZfK3YvvePBqZeTxyvytifSo7pFOKLySQN2/ComfyUI_00004_.png",
        "positive_prompt": "a portrait photo of a cat in a green hoodie",
        "negative_prompt": "ugly, broken, weird",
        "steps": 20,
        "denoise": 0.4,
        "sampler_name": "euler",
        "scheduler": "karras",
        "upscale_by": 2,
        "upscaler": "4x-UltraSharp",
        "controlnet_strength": 1,
        "use_controlnet_tile": True
        "mask_blur": 8,
        "mode_type": "Linear",
        "tile_width": 512,
        "tile_height": 512,
        "tile_padding": 32,
        "force_uniform_tiles": True,
        "seam_fix_mode": "None",
        "seam_fix_width": 64,
        "seam_fix_denoise": 1,
        "seam_fix_padding": 16,
        "seam_fix_mask_blur": 8,
    }
)

# Save the output image
with open('output.png', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(output[0].read())
```
