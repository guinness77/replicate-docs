Reference

[How does Replicate work?](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/how-does-replicate-work) [Client libraries](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/client-libraries) [HTTP API](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http) [OpenAPI schema](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/openapi) [Open source](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/open-source)

With Replicate, you can run WhisperX in the cloud with one line of code.

## [Anchor for run-whisperx-with-javascript](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/whisper/run-whisperx-with-an-api\#run-whisperx-with-javascript) Run WhisperX with JavaScript

You can run WhisperX with our [official JavaScript client](https://github.com/replicate/replicate-javascript):

Copy

```
npm install replicate
```

Set the `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` environment variable:

Copy

```
export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=<your-api-token>
```

Import and set up the client:

Copy

```
import Replicate from "replicate";

const replicate = new Replicate({
  auth: process.env.REPLICATE_API_TOKEN,
});
```

Run daanelson/whisperx using Replicate’s API:

Copy

```
const output = await replicate.run(
  "daanelson/whisperx:latest",
  {
    input: {
		"audio": "https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/J5r78wKSymorzW9idAbbbJ7iXQl9GddZTwfdX5OlLJW2hLR2/OSR_uk_000_0050_8k.wav",
		"debug": False,
		"only_text": False,
		"batch_size": 32,
		"align_output": False
    }
  }
);
console.log(output);
```

Note that WhisperX takes an audio file as input. You can provide URLs and or base 64 strings here as values for the image.

To learn more, take a [look at the guide on getting started with Node.js](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/nodejs).

## [Anchor for run-whisperx-with-python](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/whisper/run-whisperx-with-an-api\#run-whisperx-with-python) Run WhisperX with Python

You can run WhisperX with our [official Python client](https://github.com/replicate/replicate-python):

Copy

```
pip install replicate
```

Set the `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` environment variable:

Copy

```
export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=<your-api-token>
```

Run daanelson/whisperx using Replicate’s API:

Copy

```
import replicate

output = replicate.run(
    "daanelson/whisperx:latest",
    input={
		"audio": "https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/J5r78wKSymorzW9idAbbbJ7iXQl9GddZTwfdX5OlLJW2hLR2/OSR_uk_000_0050_8k.wav",
		"debug": False,
		"only_text": False,
		"batch_size": 32,
		"align_output": False
    }
)
print(output)
```

Note that WhisperX takes an audio file as input. You can provide URLs and or base 64 strings here as values for the image.

To learn more, take a look at the guide on [getting started with Python](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/python).

## [Anchor for run-whisperx-with-curl](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/whisper/run-whisperx-with-an-api\#run-whisperx-with-curl) Run WhisperX with cURL

You can call the [HTTP API](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http) directly with tools like cURL:

Set the `REPLICATE_API_TOKEN` environment variable:

Copy

```
export REPLICATE_API_TOKEN=<your-api-token>
```

Run daanelson/whisperx using Replicate’s API:

Copy

```
curl -s -X POST \
  -H "Authorization: Token $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d $'{
    "version": "9aa6ecadd30610b81119fc1b6807302fd18ca6cbb39b3216f430dcf23618cedd",
    "input": {
		"audio": "https://replicate.delivery/pbxt/J5r78wKSymorzW9idAbbbJ7iXQl9GddZTwfdX5OlLJW2hLR2/OSR_uk_000_0050_8k.wav",
		"debug": False,
		"only_text": False,
		"batch_size": 32,
		"align_output": False
    }
  }' \
  https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/daanelson/whisperx/predictions
```

Note that WhisperX takes an audio file as input. You can provide URLs and or base 64 strings here as values for the image.

To learn more, take a look at [Replicate’s HTTP API](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http) reference docs.

You can also run WhisperX using [other Replicate client libraries for Golang, Swift, Elixir, and others](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/client-libraries)

## [Anchor for keep-up-to-speed](https://replicate.com/docs/guides/whisper/run-whisperx-with-an-api\#keep-up-to-speed) Keep up to speed
