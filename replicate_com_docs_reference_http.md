## [Anchor for authentication](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http\#authentication) Authentication

All API requests must include a valid API token in the `Authorization` request header. The token must be prefixed by "Bearer", followed by a space and the token value.
Example: `Authorization: Bearer r8_Hw***********************************`
Find your tokens at [https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens](https://replicate.com/account/api-tokens)

## [Anchor for predictions.create](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http\#predictions.create) Create a prediction

### [Anchor for predictions.create-endpoint](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http\#predictions.create-endpoint) Endpoint

Copy

```
POST https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions
```

### [Anchor for predictions.create-description](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http\#predictions.create-description) Description

Create a prediction for the model version and inputs you provide.

If you're running an [official model](https://replicate.com/collections/official), use the [`models.predictions.create`](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#models.predictions.create) operation instead.

Example cURL request:

Copy

```
curl -s -X POST -H 'Prefer: wait' \
  -d '{"version": "replicate/hello-world:5c7d5dc6dd8bf75c1acaa8565735e7986bc5b66206b55cca93cb72c9bf15ccaa", "input": {"text": "Alice"}}' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions
```

The request will wait up to 60 seconds for the model to run. If this time is exceeded the prediction will be returned in a `"starting"` state and need to be retrieved using the `predictions.get` endpiont.

For a complete overview of the `predictions.create` API check out our documentation on [creating a prediction](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/create-a-prediction) which covers a variety of use cases.

### [Anchor for predictions.create-headers](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http\#predictions.create-headers) Headers

- [Prefer](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#predictions.create-headers-prefer) string







Leave the request open and wait for the model to finish generating output. Set to `wait=n` where n is a number of seconds between 1 and 60.



See https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/create-a-prediction#sync-mode for more information.


### [Anchor for predictions.create-request-body](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http\#predictions.create-request-body) Request Body

- [input](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#predictions.create-request-body-input) objectRequired







The model's input as a JSON object. The input schema depends on what model you are running. To see the available inputs, click the "API" tab on the model you are running or [get the model version](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#models.versions.get) and look at its `openapi_schema` property. For example, [stability-ai/sdxl](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/sdxl) takes `prompt` as an input.



Files should be passed as HTTP URLs or data URLs.



Use an HTTP URL when:



- you have a large file > 256kb
- you want to be able to use the file multiple times
- you want your prediction metadata to be associable with your input files

Use a data URL when:

- you have a small file <= 256kb
- you don't want to upload and host the file somewhere
- you don't need to use the file again (Replicate will not store it)

- [version](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#predictions.create-request-body-version) stringRequired







The ID of the model version that you want to run. This can be specified in two formats:



1. Just the 64-character version ID: `9dcd6d78e7c6560c340d916fe32e9f24aabfa331e5cce95fe31f77fb03121426`
2. Full model identifier with version ID in the format `{owner}/{model}:{id}`. For example, `replicate/hello-world:9dcd6d78e7c6560c340d916fe32e9f24aabfa331e5cce95fe31f77fb03121426`

- [stream](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#predictions.create-request-body-stream) boolean







**This field is deprecated.**



Request a URL to receive streaming output using [server-sent events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events).



This field is no longer needed as the returned prediction will always have a `stream` entry in its `url` property if the model supports streaming.

- [webhook](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#predictions.create-request-body-webhook) string





An HTTPS URL for receiving a webhook when the prediction has new output. The webhook will be a POST request where the request body is the same as the response body of the [get prediction](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#predictions.get) operation. If there are network problems, we will retry the webhook a few times, so make sure it can be safely called more than once. Replicate will not follow redirects when sending webhook requests to your service, so be sure to specify a URL that will resolve without redirecting.

- [webhook\_events\_filter](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#predictions.create-request-body-webhook-events-filter) array







By default, we will send requests to your webhook URL whenever there are new outputs or the prediction has finished. You can change which events trigger webhook requests by specifying `webhook_events_filter` in the prediction request:



- `start`: immediately on prediction start
- `output`: each time a prediction generates an output (note that predictions can generate multiple outputs)
- `logs`: each time log output is generated by a prediction
- `completed`: when the prediction reaches a terminal state (succeeded/canceled/failed)

For example, if you only wanted requests to be sent at the start and end of the prediction, you would provide:

```p-0.5 bg-r8-gray-3 break-words
{
  "version": "5c7d5dc6dd8bf75c1acaa8565735e7986bc5b66206b55cca93cb72c9bf15ccaa",
  "input": {
    "text": "Alice"
  },
  "webhook": "https://example.com/my-webhook",
  "webhook_events_filter": ["start", "completed"]
}

```

Requests for event types `output` and `logs` will be sent at most once every 500ms. If you request `start` and `completed` webhooks, then they'll always be sent regardless of throttling.

## [Anchor for predictions.get](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http\#predictions.get) Get a prediction

### [Anchor for predictions.get-endpoint](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http\#predictions.get-endpoint) Endpoint

Copy

```
GET https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions/{prediction_id}
```

### [Anchor for predictions.get-description](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http\#predictions.get-description) Description

Get the current state of a prediction.

Example cURL request:

Copy

```
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
  https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions/gm3qorzdhgbfurvjtvhg6dckhu
```

The response will be the prediction object:

Copy

```
{
  "id": "gm3qorzdhgbfurvjtvhg6dckhu",
  "model": "replicate/hello-world",
  "version": "5c7d5dc6dd8bf75c1acaa8565735e7986bc5b66206b55cca93cb72c9bf15ccaa",
  "input": {
    "text": "Alice"
  },
  "logs": "",
  "output": "hello Alice",
  "error": null,
  "status": "succeeded",
  "created_at": "2023-09-08T16:19:34.765994Z",
  "data_removed": false,
  "started_at": "2023-09-08T16:19:34.779176Z",
  "completed_at": "2023-09-08T16:19:34.791859Z",
  "metrics": {
    "predict_time": 0.012683
  },
  "urls": {
    "cancel": "https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions/gm3qorzdhgbfurvjtvhg6dckhu/cancel",
    "get": "https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions/gm3qorzdhgbfurvjtvhg6dckhu"
  }
}
```

`status` will be one of:

- `starting`: the prediction is starting up. If this status lasts longer than a few seconds, then it's typically because a new worker is being started to run the prediction.
- `processing`: the `predict()` method of the model is currently running.
- `succeeded`: the prediction completed successfully.
- `failed`: the prediction encountered an error during processing.
- `canceled`: the prediction was canceled by its creator.

In the case of success, `output` will be an object containing the output of the model. Any files will be represented as HTTPS URLs. You'll need to pass the `Authorization` header to request them.

In the case of failure, `error` will contain the error encountered during the prediction.

Terminated predictions (with a status of `succeeded`, `failed`, or `canceled`) will include a `metrics` object with a `predict_time` property showing the amount of CPU or GPU time, in seconds, that the prediction used while running. It won't include time waiting for the prediction to start.

All input parameters, output values, and logs are automatically removed after an hour, by default, for predictions created through the API.

You must save a copy of any data or files in the output if you'd like to continue using them. The `output` key will still be present, but it's value will be `null` after the output has been removed.

Output files are served by `replicate.delivery` and its subdomains. If you use an allow list of external domains for your assets, add `replicate.delivery` and `*.replicate.delivery` to it.

Example cURL request:

Copy

```
curl -s \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
  https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/replicate/hello-world
```

The response will be a model object in the following format:

Copy

```
{
  "url": "https://replicate.com/replicate/hello-world",
  "owner": "replicate",
  "name": "hello-world",

      "title": "Text",
      "x-order": 0,
      "description": "Text to prefix with 'hello '"
    }
  }
}
```

The `cover_image_url` string is an HTTPS URL for an image file. This can be:

- An image uploaded by the model author.
- The output file of the example prediction, if the model author has not set a cover image.
- The input file of the example prediction, if the model author has not set a cover image and the example prediction has no output file.
- A generic fallback image.

The `default_example` object is a [prediction](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#predictions.get) created with this model.

The `latest_version` object is the model's most recently pushed [version](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#models.versions.get).

POST https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/{model_owner}/{model_name}/predictions
```

### [Anchor for models.predictions.create-description](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http\#models.predictions.create-description) Description

Create a prediction using an [official model](https://replicate.com/changelog/2025-01-29-official-models).

If you're _not_ running an official model, use the [`predictions.create`](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#predictions.create) operation instead.

Example cURL request:

Copy

```
curl -s -X POST -H 'Prefer: wait' \
  -d '{"input": {"prompt": "Write a short poem about the weather."}}' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  https://api.replicate.com/v1/models/meta/meta-llama-3-70b-instruct/predictions
```

The request will wait up to 60 seconds for the model to run. If this time is exceeded the prediction will be returned in a `"starting"` state and need to be retrieved using the `predictions.get` endpiont.

For a complete overview of the `deployments.predictions.create` API check out our documentation on [creating a prediction](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/create-a-prediction) which covers a variety of use cases.

### [Anchor for models.predictions.create-parameters](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http\#models.predictions.create-parameters) URL Parameters

- [model\_owner](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#models.predictions.create-parameters-model-owner) stringRequired



The name of the user or organization that owns the model.

- [model\_name](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#models.predictions.create-parameters-model-name) stringRequired



The name of the model.


### [Anchor for models.predictions.create-headers](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http\#models.predictions.create-headers) Headers

- [Prefer](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#models.predictions.create-headers-prefer) string







Leave the request open and wait for the model to finish generating output. Set to `wait=n` where n is a number of seconds between 1 and 60.



See https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/create-a-prediction#sync-mode for more information.


### [Anchor for models.predictions.create-request-body](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http\#models.predictions.create-request-body) Request Body

- [input](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#models.predictions.create-request-body-input) objectRequired







The model's input as a JSON object. The input schema depends on what model you are running. To see the available inputs, click the "API" tab on the model you are running or [get the model version](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#models.versions.get) and look at its `openapi_schema` property. For example, [stability-ai/sdxl](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/sdxl) takes `prompt` as an input.



Files should be passed as HTTP URLs or data URLs.



Use an HTTP URL when:



- you have a large file > 256kb
- you want to be able to use the file multiple times
- you want your prediction metadata to be associable with your input files

Use a data URL when:

- you have a small file <= 256kb
- you don't want to upload and host the file somewhere
- you don't need to use the file again (Replicate will not store it)

- [stream](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#models.predictions.create-request-body-stream) boolean







**This field is deprecated.**



Request a URL to receive streaming output using [server-sent events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events).



This field is no longer needed as the returned prediction will always have a `stream` entry in its `url` property if the model supports streaming.

- [webhook](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#models.predictions.create-request-body-webhook) string





An HTTPS URL for receiving a webhook when the prediction has new output. The webhook will be a POST request where the request body is the same as the response body of the [get prediction](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#predictions.get) operation. If there are network problems, we will retry the webhook a few times, so make sure it can be safely called more than once. Replicate will not follow redirects when sending webhook requests to your service, so be sure to specify a URL that will resolve without redirecting.

- [webhook\_events\_filter](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#models.predictions.create-request-body-webhook-events-filter) array







By default, we will send requests to your webhook URL whenever there are new outputs or the prediction has finished. You can change which events trigger webhook requests by specifying `webhook_events_filter` in the prediction request:



- `start`: immediately on prediction start
- `output`: each time a prediction generates an output (note that predictions can generate multiple outputs)
- `logs`: each time log output is generated by a prediction
- `completed`: when the prediction reaches a terminal state (succeeded/canceled/failed)

For example, if you only wanted requests to be sent at the start and end of the prediction, you would provide:

```p-0.5 bg-r8-gray-3 break-words
{
  "input": {
    "text": "Alice"
  },
  "webhook": "https://example.com/my-webhook",
  "webhook_events_filter": ["start", "completed"]
}

```

Requests for event types `output` and `logs` will be sent at most once every 500ms. If you request `start` and `completed` webhooks, then they'll always be sent regardless of throttling.

Copy

```
POST https://api.replicate.com/v1/deployments/{deployment_owner}/{deployment_name}/predictions
```

### [Anchor for deployments.predictions.create-description](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http\#deployments.predictions.create-description) Description

Example cURL request:

Copy

```
curl -s -X POST -H 'Prefer: wait' \
  -d '{"input": {"prompt": "A photo of a bear riding a bicycle over the moon"}}' \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  https://api.replicate.com/v1/deployments/acme/my-app-image-generator/predictions
```

The request will wait up to 60 seconds for the model to run. If this time is exceeded the prediction will be returned in a `"starting"` state and need to be retrieved using the `predictions.get` endpiont.

For a complete overview of the `deployments.predictions.create` API check out our documentation on [creating a prediction](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/create-a-prediction) which covers a variety of use cases.

### [Anchor for deployments.predictions.create-parameters](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http\#deployments.predictions.create-parameters) URL Parameters

- [deployment\_owner](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#deployments.predictions.create-parameters-deployment-owner) stringRequired



The name of the user or organization that owns the deployment.

- [deployment\_name](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#deployments.predictions.create-parameters-deployment-name) stringRequired



The name of the deployment.


### [Anchor for deployments.predictions.create-headers](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http\#deployments.predictions.create-headers) Headers

- [Prefer](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#deployments.predictions.create-headers-prefer) string







Leave the request open and wait for the model to finish generating output. Set to `wait=n` where n is a number of seconds between 1 and 60.



See https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/create-a-prediction#sync-mode for more information.


### [Anchor for deployments.predictions.create-request-body](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http\#deployments.predictions.create-request-body) Request Body

- [input](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#deployments.predictions.create-request-body-input) objectRequired







The model's input as a JSON object. The input schema depends on what model you are running. To see the available inputs, click the "API" tab on the model you are running or [get the model version](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#models.versions.get) and look at its `openapi_schema` property. For example, [stability-ai/sdxl](https://replicate.com/stability-ai/sdxl) takes `prompt` as an input.



Files should be passed as HTTP URLs or data URLs.



Use an HTTP URL when:



- you have a large file > 256kb
- you want to be able to use the file multiple times
- you want your prediction metadata to be associable with your input files

Use a data URL when:

- you have a small file <= 256kb
- you don't want to upload and host the file somewhere
- you don't need to use the file again (Replicate will not store it)

- [stream](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#deployments.predictions.create-request-body-stream) boolean







**This field is deprecated.**



Request a URL to receive streaming output using [server-sent events (SSE)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Server-sent_events).



This field is no longer needed as the returned prediction will always have a `stream` entry in its `url` property if the model supports streaming.

- [webhook](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#deployments.predictions.create-request-body-webhook) string





An HTTPS URL for receiving a webhook when the prediction has new output. The webhook will be a POST request where the request body is the same as the response body of the [get prediction](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#predictions.get) operation. If there are network problems, we will retry the webhook a few times, so make sure it can be safely called more than once. Replicate will not follow redirects when sending webhook requests to your service, so be sure to specify a URL that will resolve without redirecting.

- [webhook\_events\_filter](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#deployments.predictions.create-request-body-webhook-events-filter) array







By default, we will send requests to your webhook URL whenever there are new outputs or the prediction has finished. You can change which events trigger webhook requests by specifying `webhook_events_filter` in the prediction request:



- `start`: immediately on prediction start
- `output`: each time a prediction generates an output (note that predictions can generate multiple outputs)
- `logs`: each time log output is generated by a prediction
- `completed`: when the prediction reaches a terminal state (succeeded/canceled/failed)

For example, if you only wanted requests to be sent at the start and end of the prediction, you would provide:

```p-0.5 bg-r8-gray-3 break-words
{
  "input": {
    "text": "Alice"
  },
  "webhook": "https://example.com/my-webhook",
  "webhook_events_filter": ["start", "completed"]
}

```

Requests for event types `output` and `logs` will be sent at most once every 500ms. If you request `start` and `completed` webhooks, then they'll always be sent regardless of throttling.

    "get": "https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions/zz4ibbonubfz7carwiefibzgga"
  }
}
```

As models can take several minutes or more to train, the result will not be available immediately. To get the final result of the training you should either provide a `webhook` HTTPS URL for us to call when the results are ready, or poll the [get a training](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http#trainings.get) endpoint until it has finished.

When a training completes, it creates a new [version](https://replicate.com/docs/how-does-replicate-work#terminology) of the model at the specified destination.

To find some models to train on, check out the [trainable language models collection](https://replicate.com/collections/trainable-language-models).

`status` will be one of:

- `starting`: the training is starting up. If this status lasts longer than a few seconds, then it's typically because a new worker is being started to run the training.
- `processing`: the `train()` method of the model is currently running.
- `succeeded`: the training completed successfully.
- `failed`: the training encountered an error during processing.
- `canceled`: the training was canceled by its creator.

In the case of success, `output` will be an object containing the output of the model. Any files will be represented as HTTPS URLs. You'll need to pass the `Authorization` header to request them.

In the case of failure, `error` will contain the error encountered during the training.

Terminated trainings (with a status of `succeeded`, `failed`, or `canceled`) will include a `metrics` object with a `predict_time` property showing the amount of CPU or GPU time, in seconds, that the training used while running. It won't include time waiting for the training to start.
