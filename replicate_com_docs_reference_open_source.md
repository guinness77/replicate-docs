[How does Replicate work?](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/how-does-replicate-work) [Client libraries](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/client-libraries) [HTTP API](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http) [OpenAPI schema](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/openapi) [Open source](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/open-source)

![So many packages...](https://replicate.com/frontend-assets/open-source-D8TTApO1.png)

Open-source is a big deal at Replicate.

One of our goals as a team has always been to help unlock the power of machine learning by building flexible and well-designed open-source tools. We're motivated by the experimentation and innovation that happens when ideas can grow beyond the confines of academic papers and take life as reproducible, open-source code.

This page highlights some of the open-source projects and tools we maintain. For the full list, see the [@replicate](https://github.com/replicate) organization on GitHub.
