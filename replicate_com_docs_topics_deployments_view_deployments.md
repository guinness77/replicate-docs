[How does Replicate work?](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/how-does-replicate-work) [Client libraries](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/client-libraries) [HTTP API](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http) [OpenAPI schema](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/openapi) [Open source](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/open-source)

All existing deployments can be found under your account dashboard in the [**Deployments** tab](https://replicate.com/deployments). From here you can navigate to a specific deployment to see its current status, usage metrics and predictions.

To temporarily disable a deployment, you can set the minimum and maximum instances under the autoscaling settings to zero, or select **Disable deployment** under **Settings**. This will cancel any in-flight predictions, prevent further predictions from running, and halt billing for the instance.

To permanently delete a deployment, see [Delete a deployment](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/deployments/delete-a-deployment).
