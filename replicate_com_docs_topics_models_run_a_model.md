[How does Replicate work?](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/how-does-replicate-work) [Client libraries](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/client-libraries) [HTTP API](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http) [OpenAPI schema](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/openapi) [Open source](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/open-source)

You can run models on Replicate using the web or the API.

## [Anchor for run-a-model-on-the-web](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/models/run-a-model\#run-a-model-on-the-web) Run a model on the web

Every model on Replicate has its own "playground" page with a web form for running the model. The playground is a good place to start when trying out a model for the first time. It gives you a visual view of all the inputs to the model, and generates a form for running the model right from your browser:

![Replicate's web playground UI for running models in the browser](https://replicate.com/frontend-assets/playground-an2Vb4AA.webp)

Once you've tried out a model in the playground, you can easily [run the model from your own code using the API](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/models/run-a-model#run-a-model-with-the-api).

## [Anchor for run-a-model-with-the-api](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/models/run-a-model\#run-a-model-with-the-api) Run a model with the API

The web playground is great for getting acquainted with a model, but when you’re ready to integrate a model into something like a chat bot, website, or mobile app, you'll want to use the API.

Our [HTTP API](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http) can be used with any programming language, but there are also [client libraries](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/client-libraries) for Python, JavaScript, and other languages that make it easier to use the API.

Using the [Python client](https://github.com/replicate/replicate-python), you can create predictions with just a few lines of code:

Copy

```
import replicate
output = replicate.run(
    "black-forest-labs/flux-schnell",
    input={"prompt": "an astronaut riding a horse"}
)
# Save the output image
with open('output.png', 'wb') as f:
    f.write(output[0].read())
```

The [JavaScript client](https://github.com/replicate/replicate-javascript) works similarly:

Copy

```
import Replicate from "replicate";
const replicate = new Replicate({ auth: process.env.REPLICATE_API_TOKEN });
const model = "black-forest-labs/flux-schnell";
const input = {
  prompt: "a 19th century portrait of a raccoon gentleman wearing a suit",
};
const output = await replicate.run(model, { input });
// Save the output image
fs.writeFileSync("output.png", output[0]);
```

For more details on how to run models with the API, including how to handle output files, see [Create a prediction](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/create-a-prediction) and [Output files](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/output-files).

## [Anchor for warm-models](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/models/run-a-model\#warm-models) Warm models

We have a huge catalogue of models. To make good use of resources, we only run the models that are actually being used. When a model hasn't been used for a little while, we turn it off.

When you make a request to run a [prediction](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions) on a [model](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/models), you'll get a fast response if the model is "warm" (already running), and a slower response if the model is "cold" (starting up). Machine learning models are often very large and resource intensive, and we have to fetch and load several gigabytes of code for some models. In some cases this process can take several minutes.

Cold boots can also happen when there's a big spike in demand. We autoscale by running multiple copies of a model on different machines, but the model can take a while to become ready.

For popular public models, cold boots are uncommon because the model is kept "warm" from all the activity. For less-frequently used models, cold boots are more frequent.

If you're using the API to create predictions in the background, then cold boots probably aren't a big deal: we only charge for the time that your prediction is actually running, so it doesn't affect your costs.
