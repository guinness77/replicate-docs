Reference

[How does Replicate work?](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/how-does-replicate-work) [Client libraries](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/client-libraries) [HTTP API](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http) [OpenAPI schema](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/openapi) [Open source](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/open-source)

Some models accept files as input, like images, audio, or video, zip files, PDFs, etc.

There are multiple ways to use files as input when running a model on Replicate. You can provide a file as input using a URL, a local file on your computer, or a base64-encoded object.

## [Anchor for option-1-hosted-file](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/input-files\#option-1-hosted-file) Option 1: Hosted file

Use a URL to provide a hosted file:

Node.js

Python

HTTP

Copy

```
const fileInput = "https://example.com/path/to/your/file";
```

Copy

```
file_input = "https://example.com/path/to/your/file"
```

Copy

```
file_input="https://example.com/path/to/your/file"
```

This is useful if you already have a file hosted somewhere on the internet.

## [Anchor for option-2-local-file](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/input-files\#option-2-local-file) Option 2: Local file

You can provide Replicate with a `Blob`, `File`, or `Buffer` object, and the library will handle the upload for you. This will work for files up to 100MB:

Node.js

Python

HTTP

Copy

```
import { readFile } from "node:fs/promises";
const fileInput = await readFile("./path/to/your/file");
```

Copy

```
file_input = open("./path/to/your/file", "rb")
```

Copy

```
file_input="./path/to/your/file"
file=$(curl -s -X POST "https://api.replicate.com/v1/files" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
  -H "Content-Type: multipart/form-data" \
  -F "content=@$file_input;type=application/octet-stream;title=$(basename $file_input)")
file_input_url=$(echo "$file" | jq -r '.urls.get')
```

## [Anchor for option-3-data-uri](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/input-files\#option-3-data-uri) Option 3: Data URI

Create a data URI consisting of the base64 encoded data for your file. This is only recommended if the file is less than 1MB:

Node.js

Python

HTTP

Copy

```
import { readFile } from "node:fs/promises";
const data = (await readFile("./path/to/your/file")).toString("base64");
const fileInput = `data:application/octet-stream;base64,${data}`;
```

Copy

```
import base64

with open("./path/to/your/file", "rb") as file:
    data = base64.b64encode(file.read()).decode("utf-8")
    file_input = f"data:application/octet-stream;base64,{data}"
```

Copy

```
file_input="data:application/octet-stream,$(base64 < ./path/to/your/file)"
```

## [Anchor for using-the-file-input](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/predictions/input-files\#using-the-file-input) Using the file input

Once you have your file input ready, you can use it in your prediction:

Node.js

Python

HTTP

Copy

```
const input = { file: fileInput };
const output = await replicate.run("your-model-id", { input });
```

Copy

```
import replicate

input = { "file": file_input }
output = replicate.run("your-model-id", input=input)
```

Copy

```
curl --silent --show-error "https://api.replicate.com/v1/predictions" \
  --request POST \
  --header "Authorization: Bearer $REPLICATE_API_TOKEN" \
  --header "Content-Type: application/json" \
  --data @- <<EOM
{
  "version": "your-model-id",
  "input": { "file": "$file_input_url" }
}
EOM
```
