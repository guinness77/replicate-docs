Reference

[How does Replicate work?](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/how-does-replicate-work) [Client libraries](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/client-libraries) [HTTP API](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/http) [OpenAPI schema](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/openapi) [Open source](https://replicate.com/docs/reference/open-source)

To receive webhook events, specify a `webhook` URL in the request body when creating a prediction or a training.

Here's an example using the Replicate client libraries to create a prediction and request a webhook event when the prediction is completed:

JavaScript

Python

Copy

```
await replicate.predictions.create({
  version: "d55b9f2d...",
  input: { prompt: "call me later maybe" },
  webhook: "https://example.com/replicate-webhook",
  webhook_events_filter: ["completed"], // optional
});
```

Copy

```
import replicate

prediction = replicate.predictions.create(
    version="d55b9f2d...",
    input={"prompt": "call me later maybe"},
    webhook="https://example.com/replicate-webhook",
    webhook_events_filter=["completed"],  # optional
)
```

## [Anchor for webhook-events-filter](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/webhooks/setup-webhook\#webhook-events-filter) Webhook events filter

By default, we will send requests to your webhook URL whenever there are new outputs or the prediction has finished. You can change which events trigger webhook requests by specifying `webhook_events_filter` in the prediction request:

- `start`: immediately on prediction start
- `output`: each time a prediction generates an output (note that predictions can generate multiple outputs)
- `logs`: each time log output is generated by a prediction
- `completed`: when the prediction reaches a terminal state (succeeded/canceled/failed)

For example, if you only wanted requests to be sent at the start and end of the prediction, you would provide:

Copy

```
{
  "input": {
    "text": "Alice"
  },
  "webhook": "https://example.com/my-webhook",
  "webhook_events_filter": ["start", "completed"]
}
```

Requests for event types `output` and `logs` will be sent at most once every 500ms.

If you request `start` and `completed` webhooks, then they'll always be sent regardless of throttling.

## [Anchor for webhooks-for-trainings](https://replicate.com/docs/topics/webhooks/setup-webhook\#webhooks-for-trainings) Webhooks for trainings

In addition to predictions, you can also receive webhooks when [fine-tuning models with the training API](https://replicate.com/docs/get-started/fine-tune-with-flux):

JavaScript

Python

Copy

```
await replicate.trainings.create({
  version: "d55b9f2d...",
  destination: "my-username/my-model",
  input: { training_data: "..." },
  webhook: "https://example.com/replicate-webhook",
});
```

Copy

```
import replicate

training = replicate.trainings.create(
    version="d55b9f2d...",
    destination="my-username/my-model",
    input={"training_data": "..."},
    webhook="https://example.com/replicate-webhook",
)
```

Copy

```
file_input="https://example.com/path/to/your/file"
```

Tip

**Add query params to your webhook URL** to pass along extra metadata, like an internal ID you're using for a prediction. For example: `https://example.com/replicate-webhook?customId=123`
